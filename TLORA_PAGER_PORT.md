# T-LoRa Pager port — working tracker

Goal: run the **full** wadamesh UI + functionality on the **LilyGo T-LoRa Pager**
(ESP32-S3, **LR1121** radio variant first), kept as **one codebase** with the
existing boards so a UI change ships everywhere at once. This file is the running
plan/status — update it as we go.

## Current status (2026-08-20)

**The port has shipped.** Both radio variants debuted on the beta channel in
**beta_45** (community PR #149, @codemonkeybr) and are installable from
wadamesh.com; `README.md` and `DEVICES.md` list the pager as a supported beta
board rather than a request. Milestones ⓪-⑦, ⑨ and ⑩ are done. Only ⑦b (the
USB companion gate) and ⑧ (the on-device UI pass) are still open.

Done since the milestone history below was written, and re-verified against the
code on 2026-08-20:

- **microSD is fully wired.** `CAP_SD`/`CAP_FILESYSTEM` are **1** — the staged
  per-call-site widening finished, so DataStore contacts/channels routing, the
  5000-message history ring, map-tile SD packs, settings/crash export and the
  About-page `/BINS` firmware export all work. See risk 1h for what that
  replaced.
- **Release pipeline complete** — both envs in `release.sh`, both flasher
  manifests generated, `FIRMWARE_OTA_ENV` set on each (worklist ⑨).
- **SD recovery without formatting**: a detected-but-unmountable card now shows
  a greyed tap-to-retry row. In-app format remains deliberately omitted on this
  board; the reasoning lives on the format-helper guard in `UITask.cpp`.
- **"Save update bin to SD" reaches the pager** via `CAP_SD && CAP_OTA`
  (upstream e2d07d8) rather than a board-name list. Note that feature is spread
  over six `#if` regions: e2d07d8 converted two, which left the pager with the
  button but no worker — a hang plus a use-after-free on the status label, and
  it still compiled. All six are now identical; do not widen them piecemeal.

Still open, in priority order:

1. **⑧'s actual stated scope — the 222 px vertical-layout audit and the
   screen-by-screen focus-nav coverage pass — has still never been started**
   (risk 8). Everything that landed under M8 was reactive bug-fixing from
   user-reported issues. This remains the single biggest item in the port.
2. **USB companion device-profile frame is still untested** (⑦b). Remove the
   temporary `[DISP]` register readback in `ST7796LCDDisplay::begin()` once it
   passes.
3. Lock-screen wallpaper SD scanning is still T-Deck/M9-only (risk 1h).
4. `deploy/flasher/` now carries pager cards + manifests for parity, but **no
   deploy script publishes that directory** (`deploy-site.sh` ships
   `deploy/site/` only) and `flasher.wadamesh.com` 301s to the apex. Decide
   whether to wire it into a deploy target or retire it.

Risk 11 (keyboard/encoder scroll not repainting) is **accepted as
workaround-final**: the Alt+turn free-scroll gesture is the intended fix for
this hardware.

## Milestone history

The narrative below is kept as the port's working record — the war stories are
why several non-obvious things are the way they are. Where it conflicts with
the section above, the section above is current.

Status: **M7's UI portion DONE — boot logo, full LVGL UI, QWERTY
keyboard nav and rotary encoder all VERIFIED WORKING on real hardware
(2026-07-07)**, after root-causing the intermittent black screen to the ST7796
panel's hardware-reset line floating: it's wired to **XL9555 channel 6**, which
both the LilyGoLib doc's channel table and the canonical arduino-esp32 pins
header omit (full war story: `TLORA_PAGER_M7_HW_DEBUG_LOG.md`, session 2 —
including why session 1's radio/display "SPI race" theory was disproven from
TFT_eSPI source). Hardware-comms gates split out to **Milestone 7b**: radio
vs. a live mesh node is now **DONE** (adverts/DMs confirmed reliable both
directions as of 2026-07-11, after the TX-power fix — risk 10; still watch
upstream LR1121 ACK issue #1376 for anything beyond basic reliability), **SD
storage is DONE** (mount/browse/read/write/delete/insert-remove all
hardware-verified — risk 1h), and USB companion device-profile frame
remains untested — see ⑦b for the current breakdown. **Milestone 8
(on-device UI pass) is now active**: fixing weird UI/keyboard behaviors found
by manual testing on the device, human supplying photos/repro steps.
Notification sound (ES8311 codec + NS4150B amp) landed in **Milestone 8b** —
hardware-verified 2026-07-08 (commit `e682fbc`). **M8 is still active**
(on-device UI pass); besides the nav-coverage/222-px audit that's its actual
stated scope (still not started, see risk 8 — this is the single biggest
remaining item), several concrete bugs surfaced and got fixed this
milestone: the radio-settings blur-autosave lag (risk 12), the encoder not
scrolling open dropdowns (fixed 2026-07-08, commit `4bbfcb5`), the keyboard
backlight never being wired up (risk 9, fixed 2026-07-10), and microSD file
manager + WAV-picker support (risk 1h, fixed 2026-07-10, scoped — DataStore
SD routing/chat-history/tiles/backup were still deferred at the time and have
all since landed; only wallpaper scanning is left, see risk 1h). An
unread-message LED notification was investigated and explicitly decided
against (risk 13) — this board has no onboard LED at all. Risk 11
(keyboard/encoder-driven scroll not repainting) was **ACCEPTED as
workaround-final 2026-07-13** — the Alt+turn free-scroll gesture is the
permanent, intended fix for this hardware, root cause not being pursued
further absent new evidence (see risk 11). **Milestone 10 (SX1262-variant
env) is DONE and hardware-verified** (2026-07-13, `tlora_pager_sx1262_
companion_radio_touch` — see worklist ⑩): a real SX1262 unit completed
setup and confirmed bidirectional live-mesh messaging (public, a custom `#`
channel, and DM). A cluster of keyboard/encoder input-ergonomics fixes
landed 2026-07-08 through 2026-07-14 — Enter/Backspace chat-bubble parity,
the Shift/Caps rework, the accent-variant and @-mention popups both made
encoder-navigable, WASD map panning + Q/E slider nudging, the Fn+Shift
chord's conditional Caps-Lock-vs-Home-jump behavior, and app-drawer tiles'
focus highlight matching their touch-press accent tint — all hardware-
verified; see the dated paragraphs below and the UI-changes inventory table
for specifics. **M8's own stated scope (the 222-px vertical-layout audit +
full focus-nav-coverage pass) still has not been started** — everything
landed in M8 so far has been reactive bug-fixing from user-reported issues,
not the systematic audit itself (risk 8) — this remains the single biggest
open item in the port.

**M8 session 2026-07-07 findings** (radio + nav, all committed:
`b3c6388`/`df7f9bc`):
- **TX power was silently capped at a conservative 10dBm with no way to raise
  it** — unlike the T-Deck (boots straight at 22dBm). Found while
  investigating a real-mesh DM test: adverts/DMs sent FROM the pager were
  unreliable while inbound reception was fine (the far node's own TX was
  unaffected) — classic asymmetric-range signature. Fixed to
  `LORA_TX_POWER=22`, confirmed as this chip's real sub-GHz HP-PA ceiling via
  RadioLib's `LR1120::checkOutputPower()` (LR1121 inherits it: HP PA
  auto-selects above 14dBm, valid range -9..22 below 1GHz) and trail-mate's
  own `TRAIL_MATE_LORA_TX_POWER_MAX_DBM=22` for this exact board. Existing
  saved prefs on an already-flashed device do NOT pick up a new compiled
  default — only a fresh/factory-reset device does; raise it manually in
  Settings → Radio & Mesh to test on a unit that predates this fix.
- **Risk 1g (RX-boosted-gain never applied for LR1121) fixed** — see risk
  entry below.
- **Encoder direction was inverted** — confirmed on hardware, not a
  guess: turning the way a user expects to move forward/down moved
  focus/scroll backward/up. Fixed in `PagerEncoder.cpp`'s
  `pagerEncoderReadDelta()` (negated once at the source, so every consumer
  inherits the fix) rather than in UI code.
- **Found a real, still-partially-open rendering bug**: keyboard/encoder-
  driven `lv_obj_scroll_to_view(f, LV_ANIM_OFF)` (in `navFocusCb`) does NOT
  reliably repaint the newly-scrolled region on this board — confirmed via
  hardware logging that focus and DEFOCUSED save side-effects (blur-to-save
  toasts) correctly reach fields far down a settings page, but the glass
  keeps showing the OLD scroll position throughout. Small new overlays
  (the toast itself) still paint fine, since those are fresh objects, not a
  repaint of already-rendered scrolled content. Touch-drag scrolling on the
  other boards never surfaced this because LVGL's drag/animation handler
  re-invalidates every animation tick, papering over the same gap that a
  single one-shot `LV_ANIM_OFF` scroll doesn't cover. **Root cause NOT fixed
  yet** — an attempted fix (force `lv_obj_invalidate()` on the scrolled
  ancestor after `scroll_to_view`) made things WORSE (very slow, ~5 presses
  per visible update) without actually fixing the viewport scroll, and was
  reverted. **Workaround shipped instead**: holding the pager's orange Alt
  key + turning the encoder now free-scrolls the page via
  `navScrollFocused()`'s ANIMATED `lv_obj_scroll_by` (which DOES repaint
  correctly, consistent with the animation-tick theory above), then snaps
  focus to whatever's nearest the top of the now-visible viewport
  (`navRefocusFirstVisible()`). This also fixed a pre-existing bug where
  Alt+turn always jumped main tabs even from inside a settings sheet/chat —
  now scoped to the main-tab level only (`navOnMainPage()`). Plain
  NEXT/PREV-driven `scroll_to_view` on a tall settings page is still broken;
  picking that apart further (why does one-shot `LV_ANIM_OFF` fail to
  invalidate on THIS board specifically?) is unscheduled follow-up — likely
  worth checking whether `lv_timer_handler()`'s own per-pass duration
  (`[STALL] ui:lvgl`, separately observed at 400ms–1.6s on this board during
  this investigation) is a contributing/related factor, not just the
  scroll-invalidate call itself.

**M8 session 2026-07-08, chat-bubble Enter/Backspace ergonomics (commits
`facbe49`/`bf5c682`):** a focused non-composer widget (e.g. a Settings row)
didn't activate on Enter in one specific case — fixed. Also added, matching
Tanmatsu's identical no-touch gestures: Enter on a focused chat message
bubble opens the same Ack/Mention/Copy/Info/Block action menu a touch
long-press opens elsewhere (`navEnterBubble()`, shared code — bubbles are
the focusable leaves inside a chat's `msgs` container, identified by
parent); Backspace jumps straight to the newest message when the "scroll to
bottom" button is showing (this board has no touch to tap that floating
button). The rotary encoder's own short click did NOT get the bubble-menu
behavior in this pass — that gap wasn't closed until 2026-07-14 (below).

**M8 session 2026-07-13, Shift/Caps rework + accent-popup keyboard nav
(commits `79df528`/`43f040e`), hardware-verified:** (1) The Shift/Caps key
(`kCapsPos`, renamed `kShiftPos`) changed from trail-mate's original
bare-press-toggle-Caps-Lock to conventional semantics — held alone it's a
momentary Shift (uppercases while held, releases back to normal); held Alt
(Fn) then a Shift press chords into a Caps Lock toggle. New `s_shift_held`
static, same pattern as `s_backspace_held`/`s_space_held`. One documented
edge case: Alt+Shift+O or Alt+Shift+L all three held phantom-ghosts a stray
'q'/'a' (Alt and Shift share row2; col8 is 'o'/'l' on rows 0/1 — a
diode-less-matrix 3-key rectangle, no software fix possible, harmless since
it's not the intended hold-Alt-tap-Shift gesture). (2) The accent-variant
popup (issue #22 — shows accented options when typing a vowel or
`n c s y t z l r`) was completely unreachable on this no-touch board — its
cells are `NAV_SKIP_FLAG`, excluded from the nav group by design (touch
boards pick them by tap). Added a pager-only parallel nav path: Fn(Alt)+
Space arms it, the rotary encoder walks the highlighted variant, the
encoder's own click confirms (synthesizes `LV_EVENT_CLICKED` on the
highlighted cell via `accentNavConfirm()`, reusing `accentBoxCellCb` rather
than duplicating its logic), Backspace cancels without deleting the base
letter. See worklist ⑤ for the full writeup, including the 2026-07-14
follow-up that changed what the Alt+Shift chord actually *does*.

**Same session, Milestone 10 (SX1262-variant env) — DONE, hardware-verified
(commit `4b0c2e9`):** a real SX1262 unit completed setup and confirmed
bidirectional live-mesh messaging (public, a custom `#` channel, and DM).
Full writeup, including the `target.h` missing-include bug found and fixed,
is in worklist ⑩ and `TLORA_PAGER_PORT_MILESTONES.md`'s Milestone 10.

**Same session, WASD map panning + Q/E slider nudge (commit `9881bb0`),
hardware-verified:** the Map tab's pan/drag needed a no-touch equivalent —
W/A/S/D now pan north/west/south/east while the Map tab is active, reusing
`mapNudge()` (previously Tanmatsu's Ctrl+Arrow-only helper, widened to
`defined(HAS_TANMATSU) || defined(TLORA_PAGER)`). This freed up D from the
existing slider-nudge binding (added 2026-07-08 for Control Center
brightness / Settings sliders / the map zoom bar, since none of those can
be dragged without touch or a trackball), which moved from D/F to Q/E so
the two gestures never collide (e.g. the map zoom slider focused while
WASD-panning).

**M8 session 2026-07-14, four more hardware-verified fixes:**
1. **Encoder short click now opens the message action menu too** (commit
   `c4c28d4`) — the 2026-07-08 fix above only wired this into keyboard
   Enter; the encoder's short click still sent a plain `LV_KEY_ENTER` a
   bubble doesn't react to. `updatePagerEncoder()`'s short-click branch now
   calls `navEnterBubble()` first, mirroring `handleHwKey()` exactly.
2. **Fn+Shift's effect now depends on UI state** (commit `b16206b`) — the
   chord used to toggle Caps Lock unconditionally, even with no text field
   focused to see the change reflected in, which was reported as surprising
   and purposeless outside of typing. `PagerKeyboard.cpp` no longer decides
   the effect (it has no UI visibility) — it only reports the chord via
   `pagerKeyboardConsumeAltShiftChord()`; `UITask.cpp`'s new
   `updatePagerAltShiftChord()` toggles Caps Lock ONLY while a text field is
   actually being edited (same "ta" derivation `handleHwKey()`'s TLORA_PAGER
   branch already uses to tell a bound-but-unfocused field apart from one
   actually being edited), and is a no-op everywhere else. Alt+Backspace is
   the context-independent Home shortcut.
3. **@-mention contact picker made encoder-navigable** (commit `57802eb`) —
   the same unreachable-without-touch problem the accent box had, fixed the
   same way (`mentionNavRestyle()`/`mentionNavConfirm()` mirror
   `accentNavRestyle()`/`accentNavConfirm()` almost exactly), with one
   deliberate difference: it grabs the encoder the INSTANT the list appears
   rather than requiring an explicit Fn+Space arm, since — unlike the accent
   box, which pops up after nearly every letter typed and must not steal
   focus from ongoing typing — the mention list only shows once the user
   has deliberately typed "@partial" looking for someone to pick, so there's
   no ongoing typing to protect.
4. **App-drawer tiles' keyboard/encoder focus highlight normalized to their
   own accent tint** (commit `6073b6f`) — tiles previously fell through to
   `navFocusCb`'s generic white reverse-video fill when focused via
   keyboard/encoder nav (a solid white block over a small rounded icon chip
   read as a glitch), instead of the accent-tinted `LV_STATE_PRESSED` look
   they already show on a touch press. New `NAV_ACCENTFOCUS_FLAG`
   (`LV_OBJ_FLAG_USER_3`) lets `navFocusCb` special-case flagged objects
   (mirrors the existing switch/slider special-case) to use that same
   accent tint for both states, on every board — not just the pager.

All three envs build green — Milestone ⑥ (UITask wiring)
landed; the pager is a first-class, non-touch UI target. Board JSON verified
(`boards/lilygo-t-lora-pager.json`). Milestones ①–⑥ (variant skeleton, LR1121
radio glue, ST7796 display + AW9364 backlight, platformio.ini env, TCA8418
keyboard + rotary encoder drivers, UITask wiring) landed.
`[env:tlora_pager_lr1121_companion_radio_touch]` compiles clean: **RAM 23.8%
(78088/327680 B), Flash 66.4% (2696465/4063232 B)** — both still comfortably
lower than the two shipping boards (Heltec V4/T-Deck: RAM 25.3%, Flash 73.5%,
unchanged — confirmed byte-identical to pre-M6, zero regression). M1–M5's
build-blocking fixes (variant/pins split, radio-wrapper include paths, the
minimal display-typedef addition) are recorded in Decisions ②/⑧ and worklist
③/⑤ below; M6's own findings follow.

**M6 findings** — the UI-inventory table + worklist ⑥ below have full detail;
the highlights:
- **Two capability flags I initially set were premature and had to be walked
  back**: `CAP_SD`/`CAP_FILESYSTEM` looked right from the hardware table (the
  pager does have a microSD slot), but the actual mount code
  (`fmSdTryMount()`, `#include <SD.h>`) is still hardcoded to
  `HAS_TDECK_GT911` specifically — `device_caps.h`'s own `CAP_SD` flag was
  never actually wired to it. Turning it on for the pager just produced
  `SD`/`CARD_NONE`/`fmSdTryMount` "not declared" errors, not real SD support.
  Set back to 0 — a real mount needs its own pager-specific wiring (CS 21, a
  non-T-Deck shared-SPI helper), unscheduled follow-up, not this milestone.
- **`navMaybeRebuild()` — the function that actually populates the LVGL focus
  group every screen — was unreachable for the pager** in my first pass: it's
  only called under `#if defined(HAS_TANMATSU) ... #elif CAP_TRACKBALL ...`,
  neither of which the pager matches. Without a fix here the KEYPAD indev
  would have an eternally-empty focus group — nothing focusable, navigation
  completely dead, despite the indev registration itself being correct. Added
  a `#elif defined(TLORA_PAGER)` arm.
- **A self-inflicted `#elif` scoping mistake**: `handleHwKey()` (and several
  helpers it calls) live inside a large, multiply "paused and reopened"
  `#if defined(HAS_TDECK_KEYBOARD)` region. Widening the wrong reopen point
  first orphaned ~50 lines of genuinely T-Deck-specific code (keyboard
  backlight-mode timer, notify-flash, spacebar-lock countdown) into what was
  meant to be the pager's own simpler branch. Fixed by tracing each reopen's
  actual `#endif` (nesting depth, not just grep hits) before touching it, and
  keeping the T-Deck-only pieces under their own unwidened, more specific gate.
- **`isDismissKey()`'s T-Deck logic doesn't transfer**: it treats the letters
  p/q/a as "dismiss popup" because the T-Deck's sparse keyboard has no
  dedicated Esc key. The pager's full QWERTY types those letters constantly —
  reusing that mapping would eat normal typing. Returns `false` for the pager
  instead; the rotary encoder's long-press already covers ESC.
**Execution playbook: `TLORA_PAGER_PORT_MILESTONES.md`** — the worklist below,
broken into agent-executable milestones with gates and per-file instructions.

## Why this port is cheaper than it looks

The scary part — "the device has no touchscreen" — is **already solved in this
codebase**. UITask carries a complete non-touch navigation layer built for the
Tanmatsu (keypad-only) and the T-Deck trackball D-pad mode:

- **Focus-group nav**: `s_nav_group` (`lv_group_t`), amber focus ring + scroll-into-view
  (`navFocusCb`), per-screen group rebuild (`navMaybeRebuild`), 2-D directional focus
  (`navMoveDir`), tab-bar handling (`navOnTabBar`/`navSwitchTab`) — `UITask.cpp` ~2138–3128.
- **A KEYPAD indev + key FIFO**: `navFifoPush/Pop` feeds `LV_KEY_UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT/
  NEXT/PREV/ENTER/ESC` into `tanmatsuKeypadRead` (`UITask.cpp` ~3000). The Tanmatsu
  registers ONLY this indev (no pointer) — `UITask.cpp` ~35706–35717. **That branch is
  the pager's template.**
- **Physical-keyboard routing**: `handleHwKey()` (`UITask.cpp` ~27990) routes keys
  into the focused textarea (edit mode) or into nav (navigate mode, `s_nav_ta_editing`
  flag), with the on-screen LVGL keyboard suppressed — exactly how the T-Deck works
  today. The pager's QWERTY plugs into this unchanged.
- **Rotary encoder**: no `LV_INDEV_TYPE_ENCODER` needed — encoder ticks map to
  `navFifoPush(LV_KEY_NEXT/PREV)` (focus walk), press → `ENTER`, long-press → `ESC`.
  Reuses everything above.

So the genuinely NEW work is: the **480×222 ST7796 display driver + layout pass**,
the **TCA8418 keyboard driver** (raw matrix → chars, unlike the T-Deck's C3 which
resolves ASCII for us), the **rotary driver**, the **LR1121 radio glue**, and a
**board class** whose battery/power goes through I²C chips (fuel gauge + IO
expander) instead of an ADC pin.

## Hardware / platform facts

Confirmed from the LilyGo product page, CNX-Software (2025-08-12), Meshtastic docs,
and cross-checked against three working/authoritative sources: upstream
`meshcore-dev/MeshCore`'s pager target (see caveat under Decision ②), the official
[LilyGoLib hardware page](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGoLib/blob/master/docs/hardware/lilygo-t-lora-pager.md),
and `~/dev/trail-mate` (local project with a running LR1121 pager build — pin map
below is from its `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/pins_arduino.h`, which is
byte-identical on every pin/channel to the canonical
[`espressif/arduino-esp32` pins_arduino.h](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/blob/master/variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/pins_arduino.h)
for this board). **Caveat**: the LilyGoLib page's own "Pins Map" table has
internal inconsistencies for the XL9555 channel assignments (e.g. it lists
keyboard-enable at ch10 and SD-detect/enable at ch12/ch14, which contradicts
its own "PowerManage Channel" table on the same page *and* the canonical
arduino-esp32 header). We treat the arduino-esp32 header + trail-mate (which
agree with each other and with the "PowerManage Channel" table) as ground
truth — that's what our own `TLoraPagerBoard.cpp` already uses.

## Board JSON — VERIFIED ✅ (landed as `boards/lilygo-t-lora-pager.json`)

The JSON (Meshtastic-lineage; byte-identical to trail-mate's copy) is **correct for
the LR1121 unit but radio-agnostic**: it describes only the S3 module (flash/PSRAM/
USB id/CDC-on-boot), which every radio variant of the pager shares. The radio is
selected by our build flags (`RADIO_CLASS`/`WRAPPER_CLASS` + pins), same as the
existing boards. Notes:

- `partitions: app3M_fat9M_16MB.csv` is just the default — we override with our own
  OTA+tiles+spiffs csv via `board_build.partitions` (see worklist ①).
- `variant: lilygo_tlora_pager` + `variants_dir: variants` → needs
  `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/pins_arduino.h` (write our own; don't copy
  trail-mate's — it brands `USB_PRODUCT "TRAIL MATE"`).
- `-DARDUINO_USB_MODE=1` (HW-CDC) is in the JSON's extra_flags. The T-Deck ships
  MODE=1 fine; the Heltec V4 regressed on it (large companion frames dropped —
  see the note in `platformio.ini`). **Verify the device-profile frame over USB
  companion early** (worklist ⑦); if it drops bytes, switch to TinyUSB CDC like
  the V4.

## Decisions (architecture)

1. **Normal PlatformIO env, T-Deck model** — NOT the Tanmatsu IDF-subproject route.
   The pager is a plain ESP32-S3 Arduino target; it slots into `platformio.ini`
   next to the existing two envs and into `release.sh`'s env list later.
2. **LR1121 wrappers vendored in the variant dir — zero core-fork churn for
   bring-up.** The core fork (`core-v1.16.5`) only has `CustomLR1110*`.
   **Re-verified 2026-07-06: upstream `meshcore-dev/MeshCore`'s `main` branch does
   NOT currently have `CustomLR1121*` or a `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/` dir**
   (checked `src/helpers/radiolib/` — only `CustomLR1110{,Wrapper}.h` exists there
   too; issue [meshcore-dev/MeshCore#861](https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore/issues/861)
   "Support for LR1121" is still open). Earlier research that assumed an
   upstream crib source was wrong or looked at a branch/fork that no longer
   exists — **re-check upstream at Milestone ② time**, but plan for having to
   author `CustomLR1121{,Wrapper}.h` ourselves by adapting the core fork's own
   `CustomLR1110{,Wrapper}.h` pair (same RadioLib `LR11x0` family — swap the
   base type from `LR1110` to `LR1121`), cross-checked against trail-mate's
   `initLoRa()` (which drives RadioLib's stock `LR1121` class directly, no
   custom wrapper) for the RF-switch table / `setTCXO` sequence. Since
   `CustomLR1121{,Wrapper}.h` only subclass RadioLib's `LR1121` and the core's
   `RadioLibWrapper` (both on the include path), they can live in
   `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/` for now and move into the fork at the next
   `core-*` tag. Precedent: the Tanmatsu keeps its whole radio bridge in its
   variant dir.
   **Found at Milestone ④'s first real compile**: `CustomLR1121Wrapper.h`'s
   bare quoted `#include "RadioLibWrappers.h"`/`"LR11x0Reset.h"` (copied
   verbatim from `CustomLR1110Wrapper.h`'s shape) don't resolve — those work
   in the core fork only because the file sits in the *same*
   `src/helpers/radiolib/` directory as its targets (quote-include searches
   the including file's own directory first); ours lives in the variant dir
   instead. Fixed to angle-bracket `<helpers/radiolib/...>` includes, matching
   `target.h`'s already-correct pattern for the same headers.
3. **LR1121 init is explicit** (no `std_init`): RF-switch table on **DIO5/DIO6**
   (`STBY {L,L} / RX {L,H} / TX {H,L} / TX_HP {H,L}`) + **`setTCXO(3.0f)`** —
   confirmed in both trail-mate (`boards/tlora_pager/src/tlora_pager_board.cpp`,
   `initLoRa()`) and upstream. Sync word / preamble / CR come from the same
   NodePrefs plumbing as the other boards so it interoperates with the mesh.
4. **Display = new `ST7796LCDDisplay` app-side** (in `src/helpers/ui/`), implementing
   the core's `DisplayDriver` interface (`begin/width/height/startFrame/endFrame/
   setDisplayRotation/writePixelsRGB565`) — that's all the LVGL flush path uses.
   TFT_eSPI has `ST7796_DRIVER` (`USER_SETUP_LOADED` + `-D` pin set).
   **Correction, landed with Milestone ③**: "the Heltec V4 already builds on
   TFT_eSPI, so mirror that wiring" was wrong — `ST7789LCDDisplay` (Heltec
   V4's *and* T-Deck's display class, same file) is actually Adafruit_GFX/
   Adafruit_ST7789-based; Heltec V4's TFT_eSPI lib_dep/`-D` flags are
   vestigial (nothing else in the repo `#include`s `TFT_eSPI.h`). This makes
   `ST7796LCDDisplay` the first real TFT_eSPI consumer in this codebase —
   every method call was verified directly against the pinned
   `bodmer/TFT_eSPI @ ^2.5.43` source, not cribbed from the sibling class.
   **Also found and mitigated**: this panel's 222px glass is narrower than
   the ST7796 controller's 320px GRAM, requiring a 49px column/row offset
   that TFT_eSPI only applies automatically when `-D CGRAM_OFFSET=1` is set —
   missing from this decision's original flag list; a `#error` guard in
   `ST7796LCDDisplay.cpp` now catches the omission at M4 compile time (see
   worklist ③ for the full writeup). Backlight is the AW9364 (stepped pulse
   dimming), not a plain GPIO PWM — wrapped in `ST7796LCDDisplay` itself using
   `lewisxhe/SensorLib`'s `AW9364LedDriver` directly (a maintained library,
   already an M1-established dependency) rather than a hand-rolled driver.
5. **Input = the Tanmatsu registration branch** (KEYPAD indev + `s_nav_group` only,
   no pointer indev), gated by a new device cap. Rotary → nav FIFO; TCA8418 →
   `handleHwKey()`. New pollable drivers in `src/helpers/input/` following the
   existing style (begin/poll/read API, no LVGL inside the driver).
6. **Battery/power via libraries, not hand-rolled** (CONTRIBUTING rule): lewisxhe
   **SensorLib** covers BQ27220 (`GaugeBQ27220`), XL9555 (`ExtensionIOXL9555`),
   PCF85063, DRV2605; **XPowersLib** covers the BQ25896. `TLoraPagerBoard :
   public ESP32Board` overrides `getBattMilliVolts()` (gauge query),
   `getManufacturerName()`, power-rail bring-up in `begin()` (expander), and sleep.
7. **One codebase**: all pager-specific UI behavior rides existing/new `CAP_*`
   flags in `src/ui-touch/device_caps.h` — no forked screens.
8. **`variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/` app glue and the board's Arduino "variant"
   pin map had to split into two directories** — found only by actually
   compiling in Milestone ④, not anticipated by any earlier decision.
   PlatformIO's arduino-esp32 build script (`platformio-build.py`) always
   compiles every source file under `board_build.variants_dir/<board.variant>/`
   as a separate `FrameworkArduinoVariant` library, in a build context with
   none of our app's `lib_deps` include paths. T-Deck/Heltec V4 never hit this
   because their board JSONs point `"variant"` at a variant the *framework*
   already bundles (`esp32s3`, `heltec_v4`) — completely separate from our own
   `variants/lilygo_tdeck/`/`variants/heltec_v4/` app-glue directories, zero
   collision. The pager has no framework-bundled variant, so its board JSON
   was forced to set `"variants_dir": "variants"`, pointing PlatformIO's
   variant resolution at the exact same directory we'd used for
   `TLoraPagerBoard.*`/`target.*`/`CustomLR1121*` — so the framework tried to
   compile those too, and failed on missing `Wire.h`/`RadioLib.h`. Fixed by
   moving `pins_arduino.h` alone into a new `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager_pins/`
   folder and pointing the board JSON's `"variant"` there instead; our own
   `TLoraPagerBoard.*`/`target.*`/`CustomLR1121*` stay in
   `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/`, reached only via our own
   `build_src_filter`, exactly once. Confirmed safe against
   `get_partition_table_csv()`'s similar `variants_dir`-based fallback logic
   (moot here since `board_build.partitions` is set to a full explicit path,
   which that function returns verbatim once its variant-relative lookup
   attempts fail).

9. **Notification sound: hand-rolled ES8311 driver, not a vendored codec HAL.**
   `espressif/esp_codec_dev`'s ES8311 device (Apache-2.0, ~4.5k lines across
   its generic multi-codec plugin architecture) is more than this
   single-chip, playback-only board needs, and defaults to the *new*
   `driver/i2s_std.h` API where this codebase's existing T-Deck sound code
   uses the legacy `driver/i2s.h` (which already supports MCLK via
   `i2s_pin_config_t.mck_io_num`, so no new API family was needed). Wrote
   `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/Es8311Codec.{h,cpp}` instead — ~200 lines,
   DAC-only, register sequence and MCLK clock-divider coefficients derived
   from Espressif's public `es8311.c`/`es8311_reg.h` (see `NOTICE`), fixed to
   a 256x-sample-rate MCLK ratio covering the standard 8k-48k rates
   `wavParse()` already accepts. Matches this port's own precedent (T-Deck's
   sound code is similarly hand-rolled, ~200 lines) and the milestone rule
   against introducing new abstraction layers.
10. **AMP_EN toggled around playback, not left permanently on.** The
    boot-time `TLoraPagerBoard::begin()` drive of every expander rail
    (including AMP_EN) exists for bus-integrity reasons specific to the boot
    window (unpowered chips clamping the shared I²C bus) — unrelated to
    audio and left untouched.
    `TLoraPagerBoard::setAmpEnabled()` is the runtime toggle the sound code
    brackets each chime/WAV with (amp off at idle), matching both the
    vendor's own `codec.setPaPinCallback()` pattern and this port's existing
    on-demand-resource philosophy (T-Deck installs/uninstalls its I2S driver
    per chime for the same reason). Cost is one extra I²C write per
    chime start/end on a bus already used for every other rail toggle.

## Worklist (ordered, each step ends build-green for ALL envs)

- [x] ⓪ Research + board JSON verification; land `boards/lilygo-t-lora-pager.json` + this tracker.
- [x] ① **Variant skeleton**: `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/{pins_arduino.h, TLoraPagerBoard.h/.cpp}` + `partitions_tlora_pager_touch.csv` (T-Deck's OTA/tiles/spiffs/coredump layout, byte-identical offsets). Board class (`TLoraPagerBoard : public ESP32Board`): `begin()` re-inits Wire on SDA3/SCL2, probes the XL9555 expander (addr 0x20) and enables LORA_EN/GPS_EN/KB_EN/KB_RST/SD_EN rails, probes the BQ27220 gauge, handles the deep-sleep RX-packet wake reason (mirrors `TDeckBoard.cpp`). `getBattMilliVolts()` reads the gauge (`refresh()` + `getVoltage()`), falling back to 3700 mV if the probe/refresh fails. `getManufacturerName()` → "LilyGo T-LoRa Pager". `enterDeepSleep()` mirrors `TDeckBoard.h`. BQ25896 charger deliberately left as a TODO (gauge alone covers the UI). `target.{h,cpp}` deferred to ② — nothing references the new files yet, so both shipping envs build unchanged (verified green).
- [x] ② **Radio**: `variants/lilygo_tlora_pager/{CustomLR1121.h, CustomLR1121Wrapper.h, target.h, target.cpp}`.
  `CustomLR1121{,Wrapper}.h` authored by adapting the core fork's own
  `CustomLR1110{,Wrapper}.h` (LR1110/LR1121 share RadioLib's `LR11x0` base —
  confirmed by reading RadioLib 7.6.0 source directly: same protected
  `freqMHz`/`spreadingFactor` members, same `getIrqStatus()`/`getRssiInst()`
  inherited from `LRxxxx`/`LR11x0`), since upstream has nothing to crib (see
  Decision ②). `radio_init()` in `target.cpp`: `spi.begin(...)` →
  `radio.begin(LORA_FREQ, LORA_BW, LORA_SF, cr, ..._SYNC_WORD_PRIVATE,
  LORA_TX_POWER, 8, 3.0f)` → `setRfSwitchTable(DIO5/DIO6)` → `setCRC(1)`.
  **Three deliberate deviations from trail-mate, found by reading RadioLib's
  actual source rather than copying its call sequence — see Decision ② for
  the full reasoning:**
  1. No explicit `radio.reset()` before `begin()` — RadioLib's
     `LR11x0::modSetup()`→`findChip()` already resets the chip internally
     (with retries); trail-mate's explicit reset is redundant, not wrong.
  2. No second `radio.setTCXO(3.0f)` call after `begin()` — trail-mate only
     needs that because its `initLoRa()` calls the *zero-arg* `begin()`
     (default `tcxoVoltage=1.6V`) and fixes it up after. Our `begin()` passes
     `3.0f` as the 8th arg directly, which `LR11x0::modSetup()` already
     applies internally — a second call would be a no-op.
  3. Added `radio.setCRC(1)` after `begin()` (LR11x0's `begin()` defaults to a
     2-byte CRC) to match the 1-byte CRC every other MeshCore radio wrapper
     uses for wire-protocol interop (`CustomSX1262::std_init()` makes the
     identical override) — trail-mate never needed this since its app isn't
     interoperating with MeshCore's own framing.
  Also **not** calling `rtc_clock.begin(Wire)` in `radio_init()` — see the new
  Risk item below (RTC address collision). `RfSwitchMode_t`/`OpMode_t`/DIO5-6
  constants verified to exist with the expected shape directly in the pinned
  `jgromes/RadioLib @ ^7.6.0` source (not just trusted from trail-mate).
  Env defines for M4 to use: `RADIO_CLASS=CustomLR1121`,
  `WRAPPER_CLASS=CustomLR1121Wrapper`, `P_LORA_NSS=36 / _RESET=47 / _BUSY=48 /
  _DIO_1=14`, SPI 35/34/33, **`PIN_GPS_RX=12` / `PIN_GPS_TX=4`** (see the GPS
  risk item below — these are swapped relative to trail-mate's raw
  `GPS_RX`/`GPS_TX` macro values, on purpose), `GPS_BAUD_RATE=38400`. Keep the
  standard `RADIOLIB_EXCLUDE_*` set (LR11X0 stays IN; can also exclude SX126X
  here).
- [x] ③ **Display**: `src/helpers/ui/ST7796LCDDisplay.{h,cpp}` on TFT_eSPI
  (`ST7796_DRIVER`, `TFT_WIDTH=222`, `TFT_HEIGHT=480`, MADCTL rotation for
  landscape). This is the **first real TFT_eSPI consumer in this codebase** —
  `ST7789LCDDisplay` (the sibling this was "modeled on") turned out to be
  Adafruit_GFX/Adafruit_ST7789-based for both Heltec V4 and T-Deck; the
  Heltec V4 env's TFT_eSPI lib_dep/`-D` flags are vestigial (nothing
  `#include`s `TFT_eSPI.h` anywhere else in the repo). Only the
  `DisplayDriver`-satisfying shape was mirrored, not any API calls — every
  TFT_eSPI method used (`init`, `setRotation`, `setAttribute`/`CP437_SWITCH`,
  `textWidth`, `pushColors`, `writecommand`/`TFT_DISPOFF`, `fillScreen`,
  `fillRect`/`drawRect`/`drawPixel`, `setAddrWindow`/`startWrite`/`endWrite`)
  was verified directly against the pinned `bodmer/TFT_eSPI @ ^2.5.43` source
  in `.pio/libdeps/*/TFT_eSPI/TFT_eSPI.h`, not assumed.
  **Found and fixed a real correctness bug in the same pass**: this panel's
  222px glass is narrower than the ST7796 controller's 320px GRAM (trail-mate
  applies explicit 49px column/row offsets — confirmed the source of the
  magic number: `320 - 222 = 98`, halved/centered = 49px each side). TFT_eSPI's
  own `ST7796_Rotation.h` already has this exact fix (`colstart=49`/
  `rowstart=49` depending on rotation, applied automatically inside every
  `setAddrWindow()` call) — but only when `CGRAM_OFFSET` is `#define`d.
  Unlike `ST7789_Defines.h` (which self-defines it), `ST7796_Defines.h` does
  not, and it was **missing from this milestone's own drafted M4 flag list**.
  Without it the build compiles clean but every frame renders shifted/cropped
  by 49px with no error — added a `#error` guard in the new `.cpp` that fires
  the moment M4 compiles this file without the flag, with the fix spelled out
  in the message. **M4 must add `-D CGRAM_OFFSET=1`.**
  Backlight: AW9364 stepped pulse-dimmer, wrapped directly in
  `ST7796LCDDisplay` (no separate `Aw9364Backlight.{h,cpp}` — `ST7789LCDDisplay`
  turned out to have no brightness hook to mirror at all; brightness on the
  other two boards is a `UITask.cpp`-owned free function doing raw LEDC PWM
  on `PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL`, which the AW9364's pulse protocol can't use).
  Consumes `lewisxhe/SensorLib`'s `AW9364LedDriver` directly (header-only,
  already vendored via the M1-established SensorLib dependency) rather than
  hand-rolling the pulse timing the milestone doc originally suggested.
  Exposes `setBrightness(uint8_t pct)`/`getBrightness()` (0-100, matching the
  Settings UI's existing convention) so Milestone 6 can wire it in with one
  line. **M6 needs a new branch ahead of `UITask.cpp`'s existing
  `PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL` PWM branch** — once M4 defines that macro for the pager,
  the existing LEDC-PWM code would also compile and fight the AW9364's pulse
  protocol (a duty cycle is not a valid input to this chip). `NOTICE` updated:
  added a `SensorLib` entry (missing since M1) and corrected the `TFT_eSPI`/
  `Adafruit GFX` lines' backend descriptions (both were wrong about which
  boards use which library). `DISPLAY_CLASS=ST7796LCDDisplay`. Gate: both
  shipping envs build unchanged (neither's `build_src_filter` references
  `helpers/ui/*.cpp` yet, so the new TU isn't even parsed by either compiler
  today) — full compiler verification of the new code waits for M4.
- [x] ④ **Env**: `[env:tlora_pager_lr1121_companion_radio_touch]` in
  `platformio.ini`, cloned from the T-Deck env with board/radio/display/GPS/
  input deltas (see Decisions ①-④, ⑥-⑧ for exact values and reasoning). Added
  lib_deps: `bodmer/TFT_eSPI @ ^2.5.43`, `adafruit/Adafruit TCA8418 @ ^1.0.2`,
  `lewisxhe/SensorLib @ 0.3.3` (exact version trail-mate proves works, not
  guessed) — **dropped** `adafruit/Adafruit ST7735 and ST7789 Library` from
  the cloned list (T-Deck/Heltec's Adafruit display backend; unused here,
  TFT_eSPI replaces it). No `XPowersLib` (M1 left the BQ25896 charger out of
  scope). `default_envs` left unchanged (still just the two shipping boards).
  Also fixed two structural bugs found only by actually compiling (see
  Decision ⑧) and added one forced, minimal `UITask.cpp` `#elif
  defined(TLORA_PAGER)` arm (display-class typedef only — see the Status
  line). **Compile gate: all three envs build green** — verified.
- [x] ⑤ **Input drivers**: `src/helpers/input/{PagerKeyboard,PagerEncoder}.{h,cpp}`.
  Gated `HAS_PAGER_KEYBOARD`/`HAS_PAGER_ENCODER`, already reached by every
  env's `+<helpers/input/*.cpp>` filter — no `platformio.ini` change needed
  for compilation, only the pin flags (`KB_INT=6`, `KB_BACKLIGHT=46`,
  `ROTARY_A=40`, `ROTARY_B=41`, `ROTARY_C=7`, matching the repo's
  explicit-`-D`-alongside-`.cpp`-fallback convention).
  **`PagerKeyboard`**: T-Deck's own keyboard driver turned out to be the
  wrong shape to mirror directly — its C3 co-processor resolves ASCII itself
  over I2C, so `TDeckKeyboard.cpp` never sees a raw matrix event. The
  TCA8418 (Adafruit_TCA8418 lib, already an M4 dependency) reports raw
  row/col events instead, so the keymap + shift/sym/alt state machine lives
  in `PagerKeyboard.cpp` itself. Reused trail-mate's `LilyGoKeyboard` keymap
  tables verbatim (same physical PCB) — `keymap[4][10]`/`symbol_map[4][10]`,
  Alt as a hold-to-symbol-layer modifier (no separate physical Symbol key on
  this hardware), Backspace special-cased to `'\b'` — UX choices trail-mate
  already field-validated, reused rather than re-derived. **The Shift/Caps
  key's behavior changed 2026-07-13** from trail-mate's original
  press-to-toggle case lock to conventional keyboard semantics: held alone
  it's a momentary Shift (uppercases whatever letters are typed while held,
  releases back to normal); held Alt + a Shift press instead chords. `kCapsPos`
  renamed `kShiftPos` to match. **Chord effect changed again 2026-07-14**:
  `PagerKeyboard.cpp` no longer decides what Alt+Shift *does* (it has no UI
  visibility) — it only reports the chord via
  `pagerKeyboardConsumeAltShiftChord()`; `UITask.cpp`'s
  `updatePagerAltShiftChord()` toggles persistent Caps Lock ONLY while a text
  field is actually being edited (same "ta" derivation as `handleHwKey()`'s
   TLORA_PAGER branch), and is a no-op everywhere else — toggling Caps Lock
   with no field to see it change in was reported as surprising/purposeless
   outside of typing. Alt+Backspace owns the Home shortcut.
  See `PagerKeyboard.cpp`'s matrix-legend comment for the one documented
  edge case (Alt+Shift+O or Alt+Shift+L all three held phantom-ghosts a
  stray 'q'/'a' — a diode-less-matrix limitation, not a bug, and not the
  intended gesture). Ring-buffer/SPSC/threading-contract shape
  mirrors `TDeckKeyboard.cpp`'s (single poll context, UI-thread-safe
  `readKey()`) even though the underlying hardware access differs completely.
  Implemented as straightforward polling (`available()`/`getEvent()` drained
  every `pagerKeyboardPoll()` call), not INT-pin-gated, despite the milestone
  doc's "prefer INT-driven drain" suggestion — trail-mate's own INT handling
  does extra `INT_STAT`/`GPIO_INT_STAT` register bookkeeping whose exact
  clear-vs-latch semantics weren't independently verified, and an ISR-gated
  poll that's wrong would present as "keyboard stops after first keypress" —
  a regression only caught on hardware (M7). Polling is explicitly sanctioned
  as a fallback by the milestone doc and carries no such risk; INT-driven
  draining is a valid future optimization once verified on real hardware.
  **`PagerEncoder`**: the milestone's "ISR edge-counting exactly like
  `TDeckTrackball.cpp:27-47`" doesn't transfer literally — the T-Deck
  trackball is 4 independent direction-pulse GPIOs (no direction logic
  needed, each pin already means one direction), not a true A/B quadrature
  pair, so it can't answer "which way did it turn." Implemented a standard
  Gray-code quadrature transition table instead (both edges of both A and B
  feed one ISR, table lookup yields +1/-1/0 per transition) — same
  ISR-does-cheap-arithmetic-only shape and `noInterrupts()`-snapshot read
  pattern as `TDeckTrackball.cpp`, just the right decode logic for a genuine
  quadrature signal. Divides by `PAGER_ENCODER_STEPS_PER_DETENT` (default 4,
  the common EC11-style ratio) to convert raw transitions to detents,
  carrying the remainder forward across reads — **this divisor is an
  unverified assumption, confirm on hardware in M7**.
  **Gate:** all three envs build — verified.
- [x] ⑥ **UITask wiring**: `device_caps.h` got its `TLORA_PAGER` cap block (no
  touch, no rotate, no large-screen, GPS 1, OTA 1, lock-screen 1; `CAP_SD`/
  `CAP_FILESYSTEM` set to 0 at the time — both are 1 today, see risk 1h) plus widened `CAP_KEYBOARD`/
  `CAP_KEYPAD_NAV` derivations to recognize `HAS_PAGER_KEYBOARD`/
  `TLORA_PAGER`. `UITask.cpp` changes, all pager-gated: KEYPAD indev
  registered by widening the Tanmatsu branch's `#if` to
  `defined(HAS_TANMATSU) || defined(TLORA_PAGER)` (~35706) — pager reuses
  `tanmatsuKeypadRead`'s plumbing but not `bsp_input_get_queue`, which stays
  Tanmatsu-only; forced `s_ui_rotation = LV_DISP_ROT_270` and a new
  `hor_res=480/ver_res=222` branch (~35626); a new `updatePagerEncoder()`
  (delta → `navPushTap(NEXT/PREV)`, click → ENTER, long-press ≥1000ms →
  ESC); main-loop drain wired for both `pagerKeyboardPoll()`/
  `pagerKeyboardReadKey()` → `handleHwKey()` and the encoder function above;
  `applyBrightness()`/`touchScreenBacklight()` got pager-first branches
  calling `display.setBrightness()` instead of falling into the
  `PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL` PWM branch (closes risk 1f — PWM would never have
  worked on the AW9364's discrete-pulse interface). Draw buffer already
  sized off `hor_res` so needed no separate edit. 222-px vertical audit
  deferred to on-device measurement (M8) rather than guessed constants — see
  risk 8 below. Final sizes: pager RAM 23.8% (78088/327680 B), Flash 66.4%
  (2696465/4063232 B); Heltec V4/T-Deck unchanged at 25.3%/73.5% (byte-
  identical to pre-M6, confirming the gate on every edit). Three corrections
  vs. the milestone doc's assumptions, all found by compiling rather than
  assumed — see risks 1h/1i/1j:
  - `CAP_SD`/`CAP_FILESYSTEM` looked right from the hardware (real microSD
    slot) but the mount code was hardcoded to `HAS_TDECK_GT911`, not truly
    `CAP_SD`-generic — set back to 0 for this milestone. *(Superseded: the
    call sites were widened over the following passes and both macros are 1
    today — risk 1h.)*
  - `navMaybeRebuild()` (populates the LVGL focus group every screen) wasn't
    reachable on the pager's own cap combination — added a
    `#elif defined(TLORA_PAGER)` arm; without it the KEYPAD indev would have
    had a permanently empty focus group.
  - Several T-Deck-keyboard-gated helpers (`handleHwKey`, `isDismissKey`,
    `tabForKey`, `navMenubarKeysSync`) live inside multiply "paused and
    reopened" `#if defined(HAS_TDECK_KEYBOARD)` regions; widened each
    reopen's gate individually (tracing real nesting depth, not just grep
    hits) rather than touching the whole file, and kept genuinely
    T-Deck-only sub-logic (the p/q/a dismiss-key mapping, which would eat
    normal QWERTY typing on the pager) under its own narrower, unwidened gate.
- [x] ⑦ **Headless bring-up gate, UI portion** (needs hardware) — DONE
  (2026-07-06/07 sessions, see `TLORA_PAGER_M7_HW_DEBUG_LOG.md`): flash +
  serial recipes established; boot clean; SPIFFS mounts; display + boot logo +
  full UI + keyboard nav + encoder verified on the glass (after 6 real bugs —
  stale-NVS BLE bonds, screen-wake path, TFT_eSPI S3 SPI-port index, panel
  INVON, two-SPI-hosts pin theft, and the floating XL9555-ch6 panel reset).
- [~] ⑦b **Radio/USB/SD bring-up gates** (needs hardware + second mesh node) —
  **radio joins the live mesh: DONE**, adverts/DMs confirmed reliable both
  directions against a second node after the TX-power fix (risk 10,
  retested 2026-07-11) — still watch upstream LR1121 ACK issue
  meshcore-dev/MeshCore#1376 for anything beyond basic reliability. USB
  companion link passing the large device-profile frame (see HW-CDC note
  above): still untested. **SD storage: DONE** — real mount, browse,
  read/write/delete, and insert/remove detection all confirmed on hardware
  (risk 1h). (DataStore/NVS-level SD use — routing contacts/channels to the
  card — was a separate feature outside this bring-up gate; it has since
  landed, see risk 1h.) Remove the temporary `[DISP]` register readback in
  `ST7796LCDDisplay::begin()` once the USB piece passes.
- [~] ⑧ **On-device UI pass** — ACTIVE: nav-coverage audit screen by screen (every interactive control reachable via focus group — the Tanmatsu work paved this), chat layout at 222 px, map pan via encoder/keys, fonts legibility at 480-wide, plus fixing any weird UI/keyboard behaviors surfaced by manual testing (human provides photos/repro steps).
- [x] ⑨ **Release pipeline** — DONE (verified against the scripts 2026-08-20).
  Both envs are in `scripts/release.sh`'s `ENVS`
  (`tlora_pager_lr1121_...:wadamesh-tlora-pager-lr1121`,
  `tlora_pager_sx1262_...:wadamesh-tlora-pager-sx1262`); both manifests are
  generated by `scripts/build/gen-flasher-meta.py`
  (`manifest-tlora-pager-{lr1121,sx1262}.json`); both envs set
  `FIRMWARE_OTA_ENV`. The install page (`deploy/site/index.html`, which
  `flasher.wadamesh.com` 301s to) carries an install button + .bin download for
  each variant off the beta feed. Shipped to users in **beta_45**.
  One leftover, not user-facing: the legacy static `deploy/flasher/index.html`
  still lists only the T-Deck and Heltec V4 cards and has no pager manifests
  next to it. That page is no longer the install path — decide whether to add
  the two cards for parity or retire the directory.
- [x] ⑩ (Optional, cheap) `tlora_pager_sx1262_...` env for SX1262-variant owners — **DONE, hardware-verified 2026-07-13** (`tlora_pager_sx1262_companion_radio_touch`, all 4 envs green; see `TLORA_PAGER_PORT_MILESTONES.md`'s Milestone 10 for the full writeup, including the `target.h` missing-include bug found + fixed). Radio gate (M7 step 3) confirmed on real hardware: user sent + received messages on public, a custom `#` channel, and DM.

## UI-changes inventory (what actually changes in `src/ui-touch/`)

| Area | Change | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Indev registration (~35706) | Widened the Tanmatsu keypad-only branch's gate to `\|\| defined(TLORA_PAGER)`; no pointer indev registered | small | done |
| Input drain (main loop ~37350) | Pager branch: `pagerKeyboardPoll()`+`pagerKeyboardReadKey()`→`handleHwKey()`; `updatePagerEncoder()`→`navPushTap(NEXT/PREV/ENTER/ESC)` | small | done |
| `handleHwKey()` (~27990) and its multiply-reopened `HAS_TDECK_KEYBOARD` regions | Widened each reopen's gate individually to admit `HAS_PAGER_KEYBOARD`; kept the T-Deck-only p/q/a dismiss mapping under its own narrower gate | small | done |
| Resolution block (~35604–35650) | New branch: forced `LV_DISP_ROT_270`, `hor_res=480/ver_res=222` | small | done |
| Draw buffer (~1399) | Sized off `hor_res`, no separate edit needed | trivial | done (no-op) |
| Brightness (`applyBrightness`~28906, `touchScreenBacklight`~36511) | New pager-first branches calling `display.setBrightness()` instead of the PWM `PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL` path | small | done |
| `navMaybeRebuild()` reachability | Added `#elif defined(TLORA_PAGER)` arm — was unreachable, would've left focus group permanently empty | small | done (bug fix) |
| Vertical budget | Audit `STATUSBAR_H`, `TABBAR_H`, `CHAT_KB_H`, modal/chat height helpers for 222 px | **the real work** | deferred to M8 on-device (risk 8) |
| Focus-nav coverage | Screen-by-screen pass that every control is in `s_nav_group` | medium, on-device | deferred to M8 |
| device_caps.h | New `CAP_*` block: no touch, hw keyboard, encoder, 480×222, GPS, OTA, lock-screen. `CAP_SD`/`CAP_FILESYSTEM` were 0 while SD support was staged in per call site, and are now **1** (see risk 1h) | trivial | done |
| Keyboard backlight (`pagerKeyboardSetBacklight()`) | `updatePagerKbBacklight()` tick + Settings → Keyboard cycle row (off/on/auto) | small | done (risk 9) |
| microSD (file manager + WAV picker) | `fmSdTryMount()`/`fmShowRoots()`/`fmIsAudio()` etc. widened to `\|\| defined(TLORA_PAGER)`; DataStore routing, 5000-msg history, tiles and backup export all landed later. Only wallpaper SD scanning is still T-Deck/M9-only | medium | done (risk 1h) |
| microSD recovery row | `fmSdPagerRetryMountCb` — a detected-but-unmountable card renders greyed with a tap-to-retry that clears the mount backoff. No in-app format on this board, by decision | small | done |
| Save update bin to SD | About-page `/BINS` firmware export widened to the pager (`sdFwWorkerRun`); board-specific wording kept as separate TR() keys so the T-Deck's translated Launcher strings are not orphaned | small | done |
| Chat bubble Enter/Backspace (`handleHwKey()` ~28808) | Enter on a focused bubble opens the Ack/Mention/Copy/Info/Block menu (`navEnterBubble()`); Backspace jumps to the newest message when the scroll-to-bottom button is showing | small | done |
| Shift/Caps (`PagerKeyboard.cpp`) | Held Shift = momentary uppercase; held Alt+Shift = chord (see below for what it does) | small | done |
| Accent-variant popup keyboard nav | Fn+Space arms it; encoder walks variants; encoder click/Enter confirms; Backspace cancels (`s_accentnav_active`/`accentNavRestyle()`/`accentNavConfirm()`) | medium | done |
| @-mention picker keyboard nav | Auto-arms the instant the list appears (no Fn+Space needed); same encoder walk/confirm/cancel as the accent popup (`s_mentionnav_active`/`mentionNavRestyle()`/`mentionNavConfirm()`) | medium | done |
| Encoder short click on a focused bubble | Mirrors keyboard Enter — opens the same action menu instead of a plain ENTER a bubble doesn't react to | small | done |
| Fn+Shift chord effect | Toggles Caps Lock while editing a text field; no-op everywhere else. Fn+Backspace jumps Home — `PagerKeyboard.cpp` only reports the chords, `UITask.cpp` decides the effects | small | done |
| Map pan (WASD) + slider nudge (Q/E) | WASD pans the Map tab (`mapNudge()`, shared with Tanmatsu's Ctrl+Arrow); Q/E adjust a focused slider (moved off D/F to avoid colliding with WASD) | small | done |
| App-drawer tile focus highlight | `NAV_ACCENTFOCUS_FLAG` makes `navFocusCb` use the tile's own accent tint instead of the generic white reverse-fill, on every board | small | done |
| SX1262-variant env | `tlora_pager_sx1262_companion_radio_touch` — same board/pins, `CustomSX1262`/`CustomSX1262Wrapper` instead of the LR1121 classes | medium | done (worklist ⑩) |

Everything else (map, chat, contacts, channels, settings, companion protocol,
MQTT, OTA) is resolution-agnostic or already keyed off caps.

## Risks / open questions

1. **LR1121 ACK/TX reliability** — upstream issue meshcore-dev/MeshCore#1376 reports
   ACK problems on the pager's LR1121 (confirmed still open). Track it; our wrapper
   crib should include any upstream fix. Gate ⑦ tests this explicitly.
1b. **No upstream `CustomLR1121` crib source exists yet** (re-verified
   2026-07-06 — see Decision ②'s caveat). Milestone ② needs to author the
   wrapper by adapting the core fork's `CustomLR1110{,Wrapper}.h`, not by
   copying an upstream file. Re-check upstream first in case it lands before
   we get there — would save the work.
1c. **GPS `PIN_GPS_RX`/`PIN_GPS_TX` are named from the GPS module's
   perspective in wadamesh's own core (`EnvironmentSensorManager.cpp` calls
   `Serial1.setPins(PIN_GPS_TX, PIN_GPS_RX)`, and `HardwareSerial::setPins()`
   takes `(rxPin, txPin)` — so `PIN_GPS_TX` supplies the ESP's own **RX** pin,
   `PIN_GPS_RX` supplies the ESP's own **TX** pin). trail-mate's/the canonical
   arduino-esp32 `GPS_RX=4`/`GPS_TX=12` macros are named the OPPOSITE way — its
   own `Serial1.begin(baud, cfg, GPS_RX, GPS_TX)` call uses
   `HardwareSerial::begin()`'s `(rxPin, txPin)` order directly, so there
   `GPS_RX` IS the ESP's own RX pin. **Net result: wadamesh's `PIN_GPS_RX` must
   be set to `12` and `PIN_GPS_TX` to `4`** for M4 — the raw trail-mate values
   swapped, not copied verbatim. Verified by reading both projects' actual
   `Serial1.setPins()`/`begin()` call sites and the ESP32 core's
   `HardwareSerial::setPins()`/`begin()` signatures directly, not by trusting
   either project's macro names at face value. Baud confirmed at 38400 (same
   MIA-M10Q as T-Deck Plus).
1d. **RTC auto-discovery would misread this board's real RTC.**
   `AutoDiscoverRTCClock` (core, shared by all boards) only recognizes DS3231
   (`0x68`), RV3028 (`0x52`), and PCF8563 (`0x51`) — its probe is a bare I2C ACK
   check. This board's PCF85063A sits at that same `0x51` address but has a
   different register layout (RTClib's `RTC_PCF8563` driver would misread its
   registers), so calling `rtc_clock.begin(Wire)` would silently produce
   garbage timestamps instead of a clean fallback. `target.cpp`'s `radio_init()`
   deliberately skips that call — same time behavior as T-Deck/Heltec V4 (ESP32
   software clock) rather than a false "RTC found" that's actually wrong. Real
   PCF85063A support (SensorLib's `SensorPCF85063`) is unscheduled follow-up
   work, not part of any milestone ①–⑩ yet.
1e. **`-D CGRAM_OFFSET=1` must land in Milestone ④'s pager env flags.**
   This panel's 222px glass is narrower than the ST7796 controller's 320px
   GRAM; TFT_eSPI's `ST7796_Rotation.h` only applies the required 49px
   column/row offset when this flag is set (unlike `ST7789_Defines.h`, which
   self-defines it). Without it, the pager build compiles clean but every
   frame renders shifted/cropped by 49px with no error. `ST7796LCDDisplay.cpp`
   has a `#error` guard that will catch the omission the moment M4 compiles
   this file — but the actual fix belongs in `platformio.ini`, and it's easy
   to miss since the build "succeeds."
1f. **M6 must add a pager branch to `UITask.cpp`'s brightness code ahead of
   its existing `PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL` PWM branch.** Milestone ③ reused that
   macro name for the pager's AW9364 enable pin (naming consistency across
   boards), but `UITask.cpp:~28868`'s `#if defined(PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL) &&
   (PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL >= 0)` branch drives that pin with 20kHz LEDC PWM — which
   the AW9364 does not accept (it needs discrete edge pulses per step, not a
   duty cycle). Once M4 defines `PIN_TFT_LEDA_CTL=42` for the pager, that
   existing branch will compile and run for it too unless M6 adds a
   `#if defined(TLORA_PAGER)` branch first that calls
   `display.setBrightness(pct)` instead (the hook `ST7796LCDDisplay` already
   exposes for exactly this).
1g. **RX-boosted-gain silently doesn't apply for the pager — RESOLVED
   2026-07-07 (commit `b3c6388`).** Was deferred, not fixed, in Milestone ④
   (matches M3's shared-file-edit precedent): with `-D USE_LR1121=1` defined
   (not `USE_SX1262`/`USE_SX1268`), three call sites defaulted/applied this
   radio setting only for the SX126x macros even though `CustomLR1121Wrapper`
   already implements `setRxBoostedGainMode`/`getRxBoostedGainMode`:
   `src/MyMesh.cpp` ~2540 (default pref value on first boot), ~2556 and ~3355
   (actually calling `radio_driver.setRxBoostedGainMode(...)`), and
   `src/DataStore.cpp` ~264 (default pref value). Fixed by adding
   `|| defined(USE_LR1121)` to all three conditions — safe/additive, zero
   behavior change for T-Deck/Heltec V4, verified by all-three-envs build.
   (A fourth, core-lib-only gate still exists in `CommonCLI.cpp`'s
   `radio.rxgain` companion CLI command, checking `USE_SX1262`/`USE_SX1268`/
   `USE_LR1110` — left alone in this pass since it's core-lib, not app code;
   now that the three UI/prefs call sites actually apply the setting, adding
   `USE_LR1121` there too would be safe follow-up, just unscheduled.)
2. **TCA8418 keymap** — raw matrix + our own shift/sym/alt state machine; the T-Deck
   never needed this (its C3 resolves ASCII). Bounded: trail-mate's layout tables are
   a working reference. Landed in M5 as `src/helpers/input/PagerKeyboard.cpp`,
   polling-based (not INT-pin-gated — see worklist ⑤ for why).
2a. **Encoder detent scaling — RESOLVED on hardware (2026-07-07).** The
   assumed 4-transitions-per-detent (`PAGER_ENCODER_STEPS_PER_DETENT`)
   matches this part: user drove the menus by encoder and reported it feels
   right ("encoder is looking good"), no fractional/multiple stepping.
   **Direction was also wrong, found and fixed later the same day**: unlike
   scaling, the CW/CCW sign was never actually validated against physical
   rotation — `kQuadTable`'s convention didn't match this part's wiring, so
   turning the way a user expects to move forward/down moved focus and
   page-scroll backward/up instead. Fixed by negating once in
   `PagerEncoder.cpp`'s `pagerEncoderReadDelta()` (the driver, not UI code)
   so every consumer inherits the corrected sense from one place.
1h. **microSD — RESOLVED; `CAP_SD`/`CAP_FILESYSTEM` are now 1.** They were 0
   from M6 onward, which looked wrong against the hardware (there is a real
   slot) but was deliberate: `CAP_SD` gates ~37 call sites (file manager, WAV
   picker, DataStore contacts/channels routing, tile-cache SD fallback,
   wallpaper scanning, settings backup, screenshots), so flipping the macro in
   one go would have switched on ~30 unvetted, T-Deck-only-tested features at
   once. The support was staged in instead, a group at a time:
   - **File manager browsing + WAV notification-sound picker** — 2026-07-10
     (commits `8c7fb6a`/`1514e76`), the first ~7 sites, widened with
     `|| defined(TLORA_PAGER)`. Added `pagerSdCardPresent()` (XL9555
     `PAGER_EXPAND_SD_DET`, confirmed-inverted polarity) and a pager
     `sdSharedSPI()` (reuses `TFT_eSPI::getSPIinstance()`, the same bus the
     radio already shares). Hardware-verified: mount, browse,
     read/write/delete, insert/remove detection, and picking a WAV off the card
     as a notification sound.
   - **The rest** — verified in code 2026-08-20: DataStore contacts/channels
     routing (`src/main.cpp`'s `setSecondaryFS`/`useSdStorage` blocks admit
     `TLORA_PAGER`), the `MAX_UI_MESSAGES_SD` 5000-message history ring
     (`uiDataFsIsSdCard()` admits the pager), map-tile SD fallback and offline
     packs (the Map "tiles from SD" toggle; the tile-cache fix shipped in
     beta_46), settings backup export/import plus crash-dump export
     (`doExportBackupFile`), and firmware export to `/BINS` via About → "Save
     update bin to SD".

   With those vetted, both macros were flipped to 1 and `device_caps.h`
   describes the hardware again. Cleanup left over: the belt-and-braces
   `#if CAP_SD || defined(TLORA_PAGER)` at several sites is now redundant and
   can be collapsed to plain `CAP_SD`.

   **In-app format stays deliberately out of scope** on this board (no
   `f_mkfs`/`sd_diskio.h` pulled in). The full reasoning now lives on the
   format-helper guard in `UITask.cpp` so it is found from the code, not only
   here: `f_mkfs` needs an `SD.end()` + `sdcard_init`/`uninit` lifecycle
   teardown on the live shared display/radio bus; there is no touchscreen, so
   the T-Deck's hold-to-format gesture does not map; and it has never been run
   on pager hardware. The *recoverable* case is covered non-destructively
   instead — a card the expander's SD_DET sees but that will not mount renders
   a greyed **"SD card (unreadable - tap to retry)"** row
   (`fmSdPagerRetryMountCb`) which clears the mount backoff and retries the
   single 4 MHz attempt, then points the user at formatting on a computer.

   **Still not done**: lock-screen wallpaper SD scanning — that picker block is
   still `HAS_TDECK_GT911 || HAS_THINKNODE_M9`, so the pager keeps its baked
   480x222 wallpaper (`lockscreen_wallpaper_pager_rgb565.h`) with no way to
   choose one off the card.
1i. **`navMaybeRebuild()` was unreachable for the pager in the first M6
   pass.** It's only called under `#if defined(HAS_TANMATSU) ... #elif
   CAP_TRACKBALL ...`, neither of which the pager's cap combination matches
   (`CAP_TRACKBALL=0`, not `HAS_TANMATSU`). Left alone, the KEYPAD indev
   would register successfully but its focus group would stay permanently
   empty — total, silent navigation dead-end, easy to miss since the build
   still succeeds. Fixed with a `#elif defined(TLORA_PAGER)` arm alongside
   the existing branches.
1j. **`isDismissKey()`'s T-Deck p/q/a mapping doesn't transfer to the
   pager's full QWERTY** — that mapping exists only because the T-Deck's
   sparse keyboard lacks a dedicated Esc key; reusing it verbatim for the
   pager would make it impossible to type those three letters normally.
   Returns `false` for the pager instead — its Esc equivalent is the rotary
   encoder's long-press, handled separately in `updatePagerEncoder()`.
3. **222-px chat screen** — tightest layout wadamesh has shipped (current min is
   240). Mitigations: no on-screen keyboard (physical QWERTY), slimmer status/tab
   bars, landscape chat already exists (320×240 path).
4. **HW-CDC companion frames** (`ARDUINO_USB_MODE=1`) — known-regressed on the V4,
   fine on the T-Deck. Test the big device-profile frame first thing on hardware.
5. **Encoder-only ergonomics** on long lists (contacts @ 2000 max) — NEXT/PREV focus
   walk may need page-jump keys from the QWERTY (cheap: map to `navMoveDir`).
6. **Shared SPI contention** (display flush vs radio IRQ vs SD) — same topology the
   T-Deck ships, so expected fine via SPI transactions + CS discipline; keep an eye
   on SD-write + RX overlap during history flush. **Partially de-risked in M7:**
   TFT_eSPI force-defines `SUPPORT_TRANSACTIONS` on ESP32 (its raw-register fast
   path still takes the SPI HAL mutex), RadioLib does no SPI from ISRs, and mesh +
   UI loops share one task — so there is NO radio/display race (disproven theory,
   don't re-chase; see the debug log). CS discipline is now enforced at boot:
   `TLoraPagerBoard::begin()` parks LORA_NSS/LORA_RST/SD_CS/NFC_CS OUTPUT-HIGH
   before any bus traffic (LilyGoLib's `initShareSPIPins()` equivalent).
7. **NVS-preserving flash chain** applies here too — 4-component flash, never the
   merged image (wipes saved Wi-Fi creds).
8. **222-px vertical layout not yet audited against real constants** —
   `STATUSBAR_H`/`TABBAR_H`/`CHAT_KB_H` and the modal/chat height helpers were
   deliberately left untouched in M6 rather than guessing slimmer values
   desk-side; the 480×222 branch compiles and boots (verified by the wordmark
   centering math already being generic), but whether every screen actually
   fits without clipping/overlap at 222 px tall can only be judged on real
   hardware. Do this first in M8, before the broader nav-coverage pass.
9. **Keyboard backlight not wired to any timer/UI — RESOLVED 2026-07-10
   (commit `c9033a3`).** `pagerKeyboardSetBacklight()` (M5) worked standalone
   but nothing called it. Fixed with a new `updatePagerKbBacklight()` per-tick
   apply step (simple on/off at full LEDC duty — no brightness curve, unlike
   the T-Deck's dimmable slider) plus a "Keyboard backlight" cycle row
   (off/on/auto) in Settings → Keyboard. Also fixed auto mode never actually
   responding to input in the same commit: neither `handleHwKey()` nor
   `updatePagerEncoder()` called `noteKbActivity()` (the keyboard-backlight
   idle timer), only the separate `noteUserInput()` (screen idle timer) — both
   now stamp it. Hardware-verified.
10. **TX power default — RESOLVED 2026-07-07 (commit `b3c6388`).** Was
   conservatively set to `LORA_TX_POWER=10` with no way to raise it (unlike
   the T-Deck, which boots at its chip's real ceiling), following the same
   "conservative default, tune on hardware later" note as risk 1g. Found via
   a real DM test against a second mesh node: adverts/DMs sent FROM the
   pager were unreliable while inbound reception was fine — the far node's
   own TX power was unaffected, an asymmetric-range signature pointing
   straight at the pager's own TX being too weak (10dBm is ~16x less power
   than 22dBm). Fixed to `LORA_TX_POWER=22`, matching the T-Deck's pattern.
   22dBm confirmed as a real, safe ceiling for this chip below 1GHz — not a
   guess carried over from the sibling boards — via RadioLib's pinned
   `LR1120::checkOutputPower()` source (LR1121 inherits it: the HP PA
   auto-selects above 14dBm, valid range -9..22) and cross-checked against
   trail-mate's own working `TRAIL_MATE_LORA_TX_POWER_MAX_DBM=22` for this
   exact board. **Caveat**: a device already flashed before this fix keeps
   its saved `tx_power_dbm=10` preference — the new compiled default only
   applies to a fresh/factory-reset device; raise it manually in
   Settings → Radio & Mesh on units that predate this commit.
   **Retested against a second mesh node 2026-07-11: confirmed reliable**
   (adverts/DMs both directions) — the fix holds, not just a theoretical
   RadioLib-ceiling argument.
11. **Keyboard/encoder-driven scroll-into-view doesn't repaint on this
   board — ACCEPTED as workaround-final 2026-07-13, root cause not
   pursued further.** User's call: the Alt+turn workaround (shipped
   2026-07-07, commit `df7f9bc`) is the practical fix for this hardware —
   a genuine root-cause attempt already made things measurably worse and
   was reverted (see below), so further root-causing is not planned unless
   new evidence surfaces. `navFocusCb`'s `lv_obj_scroll_to_view(f, LV_ANIM_OFF)` (the
   call every board's keyboard/trackball nav relies on to bring a newly-
   focused off-screen field into view) updates LVGL's internal scroll
   model correctly on the pager — confirmed via hardware serial logging
   that focus reaches fields far down a tall settings page (their
   blur-to-save toasts fire in order) and `lv_obj_get_scroll_y()` genuinely
   changes — but the glass never repaints to show the new scroll position.
   A small new overlay (the toast itself) still paints fine, since that's a
   fresh object, not a repaint of already-rendered scrolled content. This
   never surfaced on the T-Deck/Heltec V4 because touch-drag scrolling
   there never exercises this code path at all (gesture scrolling
   re-invalidates every animation tick, which happens to paper over the
   same underlying gap a single one-shot `LV_ANIM_OFF` call doesn't cover)
   — so it's a latent bug in shared nav code, not something pager-specific
   in origin, just the first board with no touch fallback to mask it.
   **Attempted fix that made it WORSE, reverted**: forcing an extra
   `lv_obj_invalidate()` on the scrolled ancestor right after
   `scroll_to_view` — this made individual focus highlights eventually
   repaint, but very slowly (~5 encoder presses per visible update), and
   still never actually scrolled the viewport. Do not re-attempt this exact
   fix without new evidence. **Workaround shipped instead** (not a fix):
   holding the pager's orange Alt key + turning the encoder now
   free-scrolls the whole page via `navScrollFocused()`'s **animated**
   `lv_obj_scroll_by` (`LV_ANIM_ON`), which empirically DOES repaint
   correctly — consistent with the animation-tick theory above — then
   snaps focus to whatever's nearest the top of the now-visible viewport
   (`navRefocusFirstVisible()`, new). Plain NEXT/PREV navigation into an
   off-screen field on a tall settings page (Radio & Mesh, Profile, etc.)
   is still broken without using the Alt+turn workaround, and that's
   accepted — the Alt+turn gesture is the intended way to reach an
   off-screen field on a tall settings page going forward, not a stopgap.
   Root-causing the one-shot-invalidate failure (or checking whether the
   same gap exists on the touch-less Tanmatsu) is NOT planned work unless
   something forces it back open.
12. **Radio & Mesh settings: blur auto-save re-ran a full flash write + live
   radio SPI reconfigure on every field defocus — RESOLVED, pager-only fix
   (2026-07-08).** User-reported "navigating feels laggy" on this screen
   specifically, confirmed on hardware via a `uiCp("ui:nav")` diagnostic
   checkpoint (added, measured zero contribution, then removed — the nav
   focus-group rebuild was NOT the cause, ruling out risk 11's "maybe it's a
   slow render pipeline" theory for THIS symptom). Root cause:
   `saveRadioParamsCb` (`UITask.cpp`) is wired to `LV_EVENT_DEFOCUSED` on
   every textarea in `buildRadioSettings()` (freq/bw/sf/cr/tx/airtime/region)
   and unconditionally called `the_mesh.savePrefs()` +
   `the_mesh.applyRadioFromPrefs()` on blur, even when nothing changed. On
   touch boards a field only blurs on a deliberate tap-out after an edit —
   rare. On the pager there's no touch fallback, so plain keyboard/encoder
   "next field" navigation blurs a field on every step: arrowing through the
   6-field row re-triggered a real flash write + LR1121 reinit up to six
   times with zero edits made. Measured on hardware via `[STALL] ui:lvgl`
   (the callback runs synchronously inside LVGL's event dispatch, so its
   blocking I/O gets attributed to the `ui:lvgl` checkpoint even though it
   isn't a rendering cost): 6 escalating stalls per navigation pass, up to
   8.7s each. **Fix**: skip `setRadioParams()`/region persistence on a
   silent (DEFOCUSED) blur when the parsed field values already match
   `NodePrefs`, gated `#if defined(TLORA_PAGER)` so touch boards keep their
   original always-save-on-blur behavior unchanged. Post-fix hardware
   capture: one `[STALL] ui:lvgl 702ms` (one-time settings-modal build cost)
   instead of the 6-stall escalation, user-confirmed "much better now".
13. **Unread-message LED notification (screen-off glanceable indicator) —
   INVESTIGATED, DEFERRED, not implemented (2026-07-10).** User asked whether
   this board could get a Tanmatsu-style "glance at the device anytime and
   see there's an unread message" indicator while the screen is off. Confirmed
   from multiple sources — this repo's `pins_arduino.h` ("no onboard status
   LED"), the full XL9555 channel map and I²C device list in the hardware
   facts above, the trail-mate reference port (its `board_facts.h` doesn't
   even carry an `led_present` field), and freshly-fetched vendor sources
   (LilyGoLib's `docs/hardware/lilygo-t-lora-pager.md` hardware doc and its
   actual `LilyGo_LoRa_Pager.cpp`/`.h` firmware — the same file that already
   caught the DISP_RST/ch6 bug, so trusted as ground truth here too) — **this
   board has no onboard LED of any kind.** Tanmatsu has one: a discrete
   RGB "envelope" LED on its CH32 coprocessor (`UITask.cpp:2435`,
   `msgLedRefresh()`/`msgLedFlash()`) that breathes green while unread and
   flashes white on arrival, independent of screen power. The pager's only
   real substitute would be pulsing `KB_BACKLIGHT` (GPIO46, wired up this
   session via `updatePagerKbBacklight()`), but that's the backlight for the
   ENTIRE physical keyboard, not a single low-current indicator LED — a
   continuous Tanmatsu-style "breathe while unread" pattern on it would be a
   real, likely-not-small standby power cost for however long a message sits
   unread (hours), unlike Tanmatsu's tiny dedicated LED. The bounded
   alternative (a single brief flash on arrival, mirroring the T-Deck's
   existing opt-in "Flash on new message", `UITask.cpp:10446`) has negligible
   power cost but was explicitly rejected by the user as not solving the
   actual want: a flash you have to be looking at the instant it happens
   isn't a "come back later and glance at it" indicator, just a gimmick.
   **Decision: do not implement either variant.** Revisit only if this board
   ever gets a hardware revision with a real low-power indicator LED, or if a
   software-only always-partially-on approach becomes acceptable (not
   currently the case).
