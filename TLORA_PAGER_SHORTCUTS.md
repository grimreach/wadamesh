# T-LoRa Pager: Keyboard & Rotary Encoder Guide

The LilyGo T-LoRa Pager has **no touchscreen and no trackball** — every
screen, every setting, and every chat is driven entirely by the physical
QWERTY keyboard and the rotary encoder knob. If you're coming from the
T-Deck or Heltec V4 (touch-first), this is the one board where learning a
handful of gestures up front pays off immediately. This guide covers both
radio variants (LR1121 and SX1262) — the UI and input handling are identical
on both.

## The two inputs

- **Keyboard** — a physical QWERTY matrix with a Space bar, Backspace, Enter,
  a Shift key, and an orange **Fn/Alt** key (bottom-left). No dedicated Esc,
  arrow keys, or number row — those are covered by combos below.
- **Rotary encoder** — turn to move the on-screen focus highlight; click
  (press the knob) to select. It's your only pointing device, so almost
  every screen is navigable with turn + click alone.

Everything below only fires while you're **not** actively typing into a text
field — if a field is focused and you're typing into it, letters type
normally and these combos step out of the way.

## Bottom menu shortcuts

The five main screens show their keyboard shortcuts directly in the bottom
bar:

```text
[mail] M    [contacts] C    [home] H    [map] A    [settings] S
```

Press **M**, **C**, **H**, **A**, or **S** to jump to that screen. These
shortcuts only work while one of the five main screens is at its top level.
They do nothing inside an open chat, settings detail, app page, or popup, so a
letter cannot unexpectedly close the inner screen. They also remain inactive
while editing a text field, where the keys type normally.

## Rotary encoder

| Gesture | Action | Keyboard equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Turn | Move focus to the next/previous item on screen | none — encoder only |
| Short click | Select / confirm the focused item | **Enter** |
| Hold ~1 s, then release | **Back**: closes a popup → closes an open chat → goes Home → Esc (whichever applies first) | **Backspace held ~1 s** |
| **Fn (Alt) + turn**, on a main tab | Move between the 5 main tabs (Mail / Contacts / Home / Map / Settings) | **M / C / H / A / S** jumps directly |
| **Fn (Alt) + turn**, inside a settings page or chat | Scroll the page up/down | none — encoder only |
| Turn, with a dropdown open | Scroll through the dropdown's options | none — encoder only |
| Turn, with the accent picker open | Cycle through the accent variants (see below) | none — encoder only (Fn+Space to enter is shared) |
| Turn, with the @-mention list open | Cycle through matching contacts (see below) | none — encoder only |
| Turn, at the oldest/newest **loaded** message in an open chat | Loads more history in that direction and keeps going — see [Chat screen](#chat-screen) | none — encoder only |

Since there's no touch to tap the bottom bar, use its visible **M / C / H / A /
S** shortcuts to jump directly or **Fn+turn** to move through the tabs in
order.

## Chat screen

An open chat has no touch-only jump-to-oldest/jump-to-latest buttons on this
board — everything is reachable by turning and clicking, and the encoder
behaves a bit differently here than anywhere else in the app.

### Turning through messages

Message history is loaded lazily: only the messages currently near the
viewport actually exist as on-screen items, and older/newer ones are pulled in
as you approach them. Turning the encoder normally moves the focus highlight
one message at a time, and **at the edge of what's currently loaded, it keeps
going** — the turn instead scrolls the list to pull in the next batch of
history, then continues moving the highlight onto it. You'll only ever land
outside the message list (see below) once you've genuinely reached the very
oldest or very newest message in the whole conversation — never mid-history.

### Leaving the message list

Turning **past the oldest loaded message** (top edge), once there's truly
nothing more to load, wraps around to whatever the last focusable item on the
screen is — the channel-settings gear in an open **channel**, or the Send
button in a **DM** (a DM has no gear to reach). This is plain focus wrap, the
same as reaching the end of any other list in the app; there's no chat-specific
handling for this edge.

Turning **past the newest loaded message** (bottom edge) moves into the reply
row below the messages: quick-reply (△) → emoji → text box → Send. Turning
further past Send *is* chat-specific: in a channel it goes to the
channel-settings gear; in a DM (nothing to reach there) it returns you to the
newest message instead.

### The reply row

Below the messages, turning steps through: **quick-reply (△) → emoji →
text box → Send**, in that order, in both directions — nothing is skipped.
Turning past the △ chip (toward the messages) always jumps straight to the
newest message, regardless of channel or DM.

### Backspace — catching up

**Backspace (tap)** jumps to whichever message needs your attention:

- If there are unread messages, it jumps to the first one — right below the
  **"NEW ----"** divider — and selects it, so you can then turn forward
  through your unread messages in order, oldest-of-the-unread first.
- If nothing is unread, it jumps to the newest message instead (same
  destination, with focus left on the message).

Backspace's override above only applies while you're inside an open chat and
*not* actively editing the text box — the usual rule from the top of this
guide; with a field focused, Backspace deletes a character as normal.

## Keyboard layout

Base layer (no modifier):

```
q  w  e  r  t  y  u  i  o  p
a  s  d  f  g  h  j  k  l  [Enter]
   z  x  c  v  b  n  m
[Space]
```

Hold **Fn (Alt)** for numbers/symbols, or tap it once to apply this layer to
the next key only. Double-tap Fn to lock the symbol layer; tap it again to
return to letters.

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0
*  /  +  -  =  :  '  "  @
   _  $  ;  ?  !  ,  .
[Space]
```

### Shift and Caps Lock

- **Hold Shift + a letter**: that letter (or letters, for as long as you
  hold Shift) types uppercase — released, typing goes back to lowercase.
  Real momentary Shift, just like a normal keyboard.
- **Hold Fn (Alt), then press Shift**: while you're editing a text field,
  toggles **Caps Lock** on/off — stays uppercase until you repeat the chord.
  Anywhere else (not editing a field), the chord does nothing.
- Shift alone, tapped with nothing else, does nothing (as expected).
- **Hold Fn (Alt), then press Backspace**: jumps straight to the **Home**
  screen — works everywhere, including while you're actively editing a field
  (unlike Alt+Shift above, this one isn't context-dependent). Doesn't delete
  a character or trigger the plain-Backspace gestures below.

### Special keys

| Key | While editing a text field | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| **Enter** | Send / submit / newline | Select the focused item — or, if a chat message bubble is focused, opens its action menu (Ack / Mention / Copy / Info / Block) |
| **Backspace** (tap) | Delete a character | In an open chat: jump to your first unread message, or the newest message if nothing's unread — see [Chat screen](#chat-screen) |
| **Backspace** (hold ~1 s) | — | Same as the encoder's long-press: **Back** |
| **Backspace** (hold ~1 s) *while the screen is locked* | — | Unlock the screen |
| **Space** (tap) | Types a space | — |
| **Space** (double-tap, within 250 ms) | Switches between English and your configured secondary keyboard layout | — |
| **Space** (hold ~1 s) | — | Locks the screen (shows a "Locking…" progress bar; tapping any key cancels) |
| **Fn (Alt)** (tap / double-tap) | Next key uses symbols / lock symbols until tapped again | Same |

The **BOOT** button (top of the device) instantly wakes the screen from
idle-dim. It does *not* unlock a screen you've manually locked with the
Space-hold gesture above — for that, hold Backspace.

## Accented characters

Typing a letter that has accent variants (all vowels, plus `n c s y t z l r`,
both cases) pops up a small row of alternatives above the field. To pick one
without touch:

1. **Fn (Alt) + Space** — jumps focus into the popup.
2. **Turn the encoder** — cycles through the variants.
3. **Enter** — confirms your choice and replaces the letter you just typed.
4. **Backspace** — dismisses the popup and keeps the plain letter.

## @-mentions

Typing `@` followed by a few letters of a contact's name pops up a matching
list in a channel/group chat. Unlike the accent picker above, this one grabs
the encoder **immediately** — no Fn+Space needed, since it only appears once
you've deliberately started typing a mention:

1. **Turn the encoder** — cycles through the matching contacts.
2. **Enter / encoder click** — confirms the highlighted one, replacing
   `@partial` with `@FullName ` in your message.
3. **Backspace** — dismisses the list without touching what you typed.

## Sliders

Any focused slider (Control Center brightness, a Settings slider, the Map
zoom bar) can't be dragged without touch — instead:

- **Q** — decrease
- **E** — increase

Each press moves it proportionally (about 20 presses end-to-end) and
persists the new value immediately, the same as releasing a drag.

## Map screen panning

While the **Map** tab is active:

- **W** — pan north
- **A** — pan west
- **X** — pan south
- **D** — pan east

`X` replaces the usual `S` position because **S** is the visible Settings
shortcut. Pressing **A** on another main screen opens Map; once Map is already
active, **A** pans west.

Each press shifts the view a quarter-screen and reloads tiles/markers as
needed.

## Keyboard backlight

**Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard backlight** cycles through three modes
(tap to advance):

- **Off** — always dark
- **On** — always lit
- **Auto** (default) — lights up on any keypress, turns off ~3 seconds after
  the last one

Unlike the T-Deck, this is a plain on/off strip under the keys, not a
dimmable brightness curve.

## Leaving Remote Mode

Remote Mode replaces the normal device UI with a physical-screen placeholder
showing the browser address and an **EXIT REMOTE** button. While that screen is
active, normal navigation is paused. Press the **encoder knob** to activate the
button, turn off Remote Mode, and reboot back to the normal screen. You can also
press **Space twice within 3 seconds**; after the first press, the button changes
to **press SPACE again**. The browser's **Exit remote** button performs the same
action.

This Remote Mode gesture is separate from the normal 250 ms Space double-tap
that changes keyboard language.
