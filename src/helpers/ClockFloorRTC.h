// Monotonic clock floor for outgoing protocol timestamps (issue #89 follow-up).
//
// MeshCore servers keep a per-client "newest timestamp seen" high-water mark and
// silently drop anything at-or-below it (replay guard) — and since beta_28 our
// room keep-alives refresh that mark every ~2 minutes. A device clock that steps
// BACKWARD (reboot without GPS/phone around, or a sync correcting a fast clock)
// therefore black-holes every login/post/keep-alive with zero feedback. None of
// our boards has a battery-backed RTC chip, so a power cycle without a time
// source is exactly such a step.
//
// getCurrentTime() ratchets: it never returns less than the highest value it has
// ever returned — and getCurrentTimeUnique() (which stamps every login, post and
// keep-alive in the core) builds directly on it. The ratchet is seeded from a
// persisted copy at boot and written back rate-capped (see the UITask wiring +
// touchPrefsGet/SetClockFloor), so it survives power loss.
//
// Two escape hatches keep a WRONG-future clock from sticking forever:
//   • setCurrentTime() rejects anything below MIN_VALID_EPOCH, whatever the
//     source — this centrally kills the 1902/1970-class garbage sets (GPS date
//     bugs, unset system clocks) for every path: GPS NMEA, phone CMD, NTP.
//   • a set that lands more than TRUSTED_BACK_CAP below the floor pulls the
//     floor down to it: a >10 min backward correction means the floor itself was
//     built on a bad clock, and freezing time for hours to bridge it would be
//     worse than the one-time server re-lock it avoids (which the login skew
//     warning surfaces to the user anyway).

  // falls through to ESP32RTCClock, whose set IS settimeofday(), so the two can never
  // disagree. With a chip present (the T-Display P4 and the ThinkNode M9 both carry a
  // PCF8563 at 0x51 and call rtc_clock.begin(); the T-LoRa Pager has one too but

  // messages carried the correct time — and why "Sync clock from system" then poisoned
  // the good clock: it fed that seed back in as a real set, clearing the MIN check by
